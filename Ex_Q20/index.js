// Question_20
// Think of something you could store in a array. For example, you could make a list of mountains, rivers, countries, cities, languages, or anything else youâ€™d like. Write a program that creates a list containing these items.
// Making Different Languages Array
let languages = ["Urdu", "English", "Chinese", "Pushto", "Balochi", "Japanese"];
// Print the message of list
console.log("List Of Different Languages : ");
// Print the values of array in the form of list
languages.forEach((language) => {
    console.log(language);
});
export {};
